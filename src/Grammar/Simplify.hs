-- | There are two ruels for logical grammar simplification:
-- If there is a nonterminal with cardinality one (that is non-recursive), inline the body
-- at all occurrences, deleting the rule for the nonterminal (the start symbol cannot be inlined).
-- If there is a nonterminal with multiple rules that share the same nonterminals in the body,
-- disjoin them into a single rule.
-- Repeat the rules into no more reductions are possible.
